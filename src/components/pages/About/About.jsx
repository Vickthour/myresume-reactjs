            <p className="text-sm text-gray-400 leading-6 mb-3">
              Hi, I'm Victor, and I graduated from the Federal Polytechnic, Ilaro with a degree in Computer Science. My interests are in Front End Engineering, and I love to create beautiful and performant products with delightful user experiences. 
             
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm text-gray-400 leading-6 mb-3">
             Over the years, I develop new user-facing features, determine the structure and design of web pages, build reusable codes, optimize page loading times, and use a variety of markup languages to create the web pages. I previously worked at PageCarton, where I develop and integrate customized themes into <a href="https://www.pagecarton.org/">PageCarton CMS</a>.
              Iâ€™m very dedicated to diversity and inclusion in the tech space so I try to volunteer and support initiatives targeted towards minorities and provide direct mentorship to people who look like me.
            </p>

            <p className="text-sm text-gray-400 leading-6 mb-3"> Currently, Iâ€™m focused on moving to the next stage of my career.
